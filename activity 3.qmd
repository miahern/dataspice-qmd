### Install Packages needed for .html markup

``` r
install.packages(c("jsonlite", "listviewer", "here", "magrittr", "pkgdown"))
```

``` r
library(jsonlite) library(listviewer) library(here) library(magrittr) library(pkgdown)
```

``` r
jsonlite::read_json(here::here("data", "metadata", "dataspice.json")) %\>% listviewer::jsonedit()
```

``` r
dataspice::build_site(path = "data/metadata/dataspice.json", template_path = system.file("template.html5", package = "dataspice"), out_path = "docs/index.html" )
